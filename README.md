## React Drag Selector [WIP]

This is an attempt to create a small reusable component to introduce mouse drag
selection in an application. **This is still in-progress and is not ready for
use with any application**. Once it's ready, the usage will be updated here.


### Demo

### Development

This project uses `create-react-app`. So, after cloning the repo,
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

That's it!
